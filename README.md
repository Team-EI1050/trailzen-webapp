### Branching Protocol

- ***master*** Branch. Published code.
- ***dev*** Branch. Testing and work done by the developer team. Here we will publish all work 
that has been proved to be working. When we consider the actual version to be good to publish 
will be push the code to the *MASTER* branch.
- ***<team_member>-\<activity>*** Branch. This kind of naming will be usefull to the team members 
that are currently woring on a new feature. When the work is done will generate a pull request 
to the *DEV* branch, and will be checked by all the team members to prove it is working fine.
